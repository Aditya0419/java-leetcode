-----------------------

class type definition is made up of two parts
1) class declaration/signature
2) class body

>The class declaration specifies the --accessSpecifier modifier class ClassName.

The body specifies variables and methods
Anything which is defined inside the body 
of the class is known as members of the class

the list of variables defined inside the class is 
known as member variable
The list of methods defined in the class body is 
known as member methods


The members of the class are classified into 2 types
1)static member
2)non static members

1)static members :  static members are declared with static keyword
Static members have single copy in the memory
-Static does not mean constant ,we can modify the value but they have single copy in the memory

1. non static members : non static member are declared without static keyword.
we can create multiple copy of the non static members by  creating Objects






Q) can i write any number of class files in one source file ?
ans: yes , when we compile --for every class byte code will be 
generated (if 3 classes 3 byte codes)

A class is eligible to execute only if class contains main method
Execution starts with main and end with main method

## Note:
- In a single sourcefile we can define any number of java class type, each class name should be unique
- the compiler will generate separate byte code for each class
- In one sourcefile i can create only one "public" class
- with which name i create my sourcefile there only i have to write my main method for smooth execution


 Accessing static members of one class in another class

1)Accessing static variable
syntax:
Classname.staticvariablename

2)Accessing static method
syntax:
Classname.staticmethodname()


---------------------------

# Accessing Nonstatic members of one class in another class

1)Accessing Nonstatic variable
syntax:
new Classname().nonstaticvariablename

2)Accessing nonstatic method
syntax:
new Classname().nonstaticmethodname()

Members of a class can be accessed in any other class 
by using . operator(Dot operator)




------------------
Local Variable:
Any Variable declared inside a method block/Constructor  is know as local variable
(And  local variables can be accessed only inside those methods)


Global Variable :
A variable declared outside the method block and inside the class block is know as global variable
(And it can be accessed anywhere inside the class block)



-------------------------------
# Object

An Entity having states(Attributes/properties), behaviour and 
unique identification is know as Object
(All real word entities are Object)

States : represent the information about the object
(variables).
Behaviour:  represent the actions which must be performed on the object (methods).

The sates are also known as data members or attributes or fields

A class is a defination block used to define the states and behaviour

Class:
"Class is A BluePrint of an Object"

--------------------------

## ***Reference Variable***

Its a non primitive type variable declared using java class type 

( Classtype ) Ex: Tesla t1 ; here Tesla is class ,"t1" is reference variable

### "ReferenceVariable Contains ADDRESS of an Object"

The referencevariable is used to refer Object hence it is also know as Object reference
Using Object reference we can access datamembers and methods of the Object
----------------------------
## Initialization of Object States/attributes

1)default Initialization
2)using Constructors
3)Using Blocks
4)using methods

Default values are only applicable for global variables ,
Default values are NOT-applicable for local variables


## Constructor
-->used to Initilise attributes of an Object
--->It is internally called "at the Object creation time"
(Not before , not After)
--->Constructor is a special member of class used for initialization of attributes of an Object

syntax:

---------------------
Note:Constructor name will be same as class name
it is similar to method but constructor donot have any return type not even void.


-------------------------
Constructor is a special member of class used to initialize states of an Object ,during Object creation Time
The constructor is always called whenever we create the Object of a Class

When We define a Constructor ,The following Rules must be followed
1)The constructor name should be same as class name
2)The constructor should not have Return Type(not even void)
3)modifiers should not be used in constructor declaration
4)A constructor can be declared with parameter or without parameter
5)Defining a constructor in a class provides the benifits of initializing the Object states during the Object creation,
 It makes Object Ready to consume

----------------------------------------

*** "this" keyword

java always refers the current Object through "this" keyword
The Object by which method/Constructor is invoked in known as current object
The current Object details is stored in this Keyword

"this" keyword must be used either in non-static method of a class or Constructor

"this keyword holds the ADDRESS of Current Object"..

----------------------

## Constructor OverLoading

Defining more than one Constructor with different parameter-list is known as Constructor Overloading

The Parameter list should differ in any one of the following
1)parameter type
2)parameter length
3)Sequence of parameter

Constructor Overloading helps us create Object with different set of data.
The Overloaded Constructor are executed based on the parameter


Types of Constructor (2 types)
1)user defined Constructor
2)Compiler defined constructor

A constructor defined by the programmer is known as user defined constructor
User defined constructor can be with parameter or without parameter

The Constructor defined by the Compiler is known as "Compiler defined Constructor"
The compiler will define constructor for the class which doesn't have user 
 defined constructor
,if the class contains user defined constructor ,the compiler will not provide 
 a constructor

The constructor defined by the compiler is known as "Default constructor"
"The default constructor will provide default initialization"

-------------------------------------
# Blocks

A block is a set of instruction used for initialization
Blocks are categorized into two types
1)static block
2)non static block

## Static Block/Multiline static initializer
static block is a set of instruction used for initializing  "only static variables"

  
syntax:         static {
                         //set of instruction

                        }

static blocks are executed before "main method"
When we have multiple static blocks the execution will happen Sequencially 
--------------------------------------
#Non static Block
syntax:
        {
      //set of instruction
       }

The non static block is set of instruction used to initilize both static
 and non-static variables
(but it is not good practice to initilize static variables in non static block)
We majorly use non static block to initilize non static variables only

Non static Blocks are executed at the time of Object Creation
When we have multiple non static blocks they  also execute sequentially

Important:  
1)static blocks runs only Once
2)Non static block runs whenever Object is created

-------------------------

Interview Question
In one class , we have both non-static Block and Constructor
if we create Object and initialize parameter both are called 
,which will run first ?
 and which value will be there in the Object
  
Ans) ---First non-static blocks will run
-----Then constructor will run
-----Constructor will run later so the value initialized in constructor will be stored


-------------------------------
## final Variable

Any variable declared by using 'final keyword' is known as final variable
final variables are constants in java language
final variable must be initialized only once , It cannot be reinitialized

------------------------------

Access Specifiers

1)Public
If you declare any entity as public, then it can be accessed 
by the classes present in the same package   or different package
Public entities will have highest visibility and lowest security

2)Protected
If you declare any entity as protected ,then it can be accessed by the classes present in same package   
Protected entity can be accessed by other classes present in different package   through inheritance and creating the object of SUBCLASS(Child class) only.

3)Pkg-level (default)
if you declare any entity without using any access specifiers
then it is considered as pkg-level member (default member)
If you declare any entity as pkg-level ,then it can be strictly accessed only by the classes present in same package

4)private
If you declare any entity as private then it can be accessed only by the class within which they are declared
Private entities will have highest security and lowest visibility

---------------------------------
## Encapsulation

—→Binding the data members and related operation into the class is known as encapsulation

——>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data and methods under a single unit .It also implements data hiding.

*The encapsulation specifies that a data and its related operation must be in the class  body
*It also specifies that the data members should be protected(Hide) using access specifiers


Java bean class 
(java bean class Format is Perfect Example for Encapsulation)
The characteristics of java bean class
1)The class must be public
2)the member variable should be private
3)constructors must be public
4)the class must define public getters and setters method

- the getters method are used to get the private variable values
- the setters method are used to change/modify the private variable values

get and set is not a keyword its a format


## Getter Method
to get the value of attribute of object

Format:
datatype  getAttributename()
{
return attributename;
}

Example:
private int age;

//getter method
int getAge(){
       return age;
     }
---

## Setter method
Used to change value of attribute of an object

Format:

void setAttributename(datatype (naya)attributename){
this.attributename = (naya)attributename;
}

### Ex:
void setAge(int age){
this.age=age;
}

-----------------------------------
# Inheritance
1)Is-A Relationship  (Inheritance)
2)Has-A Relationship

[base Class   or/ super class  or/ parent class]

[derived class or/   sub class  or/ child class]

- -extends Keyword is used for inheritance
--implements ---we will study in interface topic

One class acquiring the properties  of another class is called as 
Inheritance in java

The class from which members are inherited is know as
Super class/Parent class 
The class to which the members are inherited is know as sub class/child class


note:
Subclass inherits non static members from superclass
The class can inherit from another class by using "extends" keyword
Private non static members of super class will not be inherited to subclass
 because of private access specifier
The constructor of super class will not be inherited to subclass


- **In order to achieve inheritance we make use of keyword called as "extends"**
- **We also refer Inheritance as Is-A relationship**
- **Blocks and constructor of the superclass will not be inherited to subclass
(variables and methods are inherited)**

--------------------------------------------


Whenever we write inheritance program the subclass constructor must call the super class constructor to initialize the attributes

The subclass constructor can make a call to super class constructor by using ( super() )super calling statement.
If the superclass contains non-parameter constructor ,the subclass constructor makes Implicit call.
If the superclass contains parameterized constructor ,the subclass should make Explicit call.


Constructor calling statement
super()   -----This makes a call to the superclass constructor
it can call with parameter or without parameter

Rules :
1)super calling statement must be used only inside the constructor body
2)Super calling statement(super()) must be the first statement in the constructor body
3)in one constructor body only one super calling statement is allowed


 Constructor Chaining
1)"It is a phenomenon of running more than one constructor to initilaize the attributes of an object is called as Constructor Chaining"
2)the constructor chaining should happen whenever we write inheritance program

### Why Multiple inheritance is Not supported in java Class  type
Ans) Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance because constructor chaining will not happen from diff class, since more than one constructor calling statement is not supported ,It leads to ambiguity of Diamond Problem
----------------------------------------------

## Method Overloading

A class defining multiple methods with same name but with different parameter list
is known as method Overloading,
The parameter list should differ in any one of the following
1)parameter type 2)parameter length 3)parameter sequence

In one class we can Overload both static and non static methods
We can overload in the subclass with inherited methods

Whenever we want to perform same operation on different types of data or set of data ,then we should apply method overloading

We can overload main method,But the execution begins only if the main method is present with (String[] args) String array parameter.

- --"The method overloading is used to achieve compile time Polymorphism"

---

## Method OverRiding

"Inheriting method from superclass and changing its implementation in the subclass according to the subclass specification is known as method Overriding"

When a method inherits a superclass method with same declaration it is called override ,It is used to change/modify  the method body..

---

## Method OverRiding

Inheriting Method from superclass and changing its implementation in the subclass according to subclass specification is know as method overRiding
While overRiding a method ,the subclass method  should be written with  same declaration  defined in superclass

We can override only non static methods
The static methods of superclass cannot be overridden in the subclass because the static members will not be inherited in subclass

The non static methods having private access specifier in the superclass cannot be Overridden ,the private access specifier restricts the access only to that class.

\------------------------
-----------------------
-----------------



Type Casting

Casting one type of information to another type is known as typecasting
The typecasting is divided into two Types
1)primitive typecasting and 2)non primitive typecasting

1)Primitive typecasting--Converting one primitive type of datatype into another primitive type of data is known  as primitive typecasting
Ex: int x = (int)95.65; //narrowing
It is also known as data-type casting
It is further classified into two types
1)Widening         2)Narrowing
Casting lower datatype to any of the higher datatype is known as Widining
Ex:  double d = 50;  //int type data stored in double container

Widening is done by compiler ,it is known as autowidening /implicitly
The widening can be done explicitly in the code(user done ,but Widening  will be done implicitly)

Narrowing : casting higher data-type to any of the lower DataType is known as Narrowing
The narrowing should be performed explicitly in the code ,Whenever we performing narrowing it leads to DATALOSS.

Non primitive typecasting
It is also known as class-Typecasting
Casting one class type to another class
type is known as class typecasting
It is further classified into two types
1)Upcasting
2)downcasting

The class type casting can be done only for the
classes which has Is-A relationship

1)Upcasting:
a)reference variable must be of superclass type
b)object must be of subclass type

casting subclass type to superclass type is know as "Upcasting"
Upcasting can be performed automatically (by compiler)
or we can do it Explicitly
When upcasting happens the subclass Object behaves like
superclass, the subclass Object shows the properties of superclass,Subclass properties are hidden
The subclass Object can be casted to any of the superclasstype

2)Downcasting:
a)reference variable must be of subclass type
b)Object must be of super class type
(For downcasting upcasting is mandatory)
casting super classtype back to subclass type is
known as "Downcasting".
The downcasting must be done Explicitly in the program
The downcasting should be performed only on the object which is upcasted
orelse we will get "ClassCastException".

---------------------------------------------
Generalization and Specialization

Generalization
Defining a function/method which operates on different
types of Object is known as Generalization

To achieve generalization the method parameter
must be of superclass type
for such methods we can pass subclass objects
The subclass type will automatically cast to superclass type

Specialization
to achieve Specialization the method/function parameter
must be of subclass type.
For such method we cannot pass different type of Objects

Generalization is used to work on common properties
and functionalities where as Specialization is defined
to work on specific properties of subclass



--------------------------------
Polymorphism

Ability of a method to behave differently
,when different Objects are acting upon it,
is known as polymorphism

(Polymorphism means many forms)

An Object showing different behaviour
at different stages of the life cycle is known
as polymorphism

There are two types of polymorphism
1)compile time polymorphism(method Overloading)
2)Run time polymorphism(method Overriding)

 Method Binding
Associating/mapping the method definition/signature
to its method Implementation/body is called
as method Binding
-----------------------------------------
--------------------------------
## Memory Allocation in java

The JVM uses 4   memory area during execution
1)Heap area 2)class area 3)method area 4)stack area

1)Heap area: heap area is used to store objects , the objects created in program gets a memory allocation in heap area
In other words Non static members of the class are loaded in the heap area

2)Class area / class static area: the class area is used to store the static members of the class
For each class created in the project a separate area is reserved in the class area and that area is known as static pool
Static pool contains only static members of the class

3)The method area stores ,the method body statements But the method declaration part of a method is always stored in either heap area or class area

If a  method is non static method , the method declaration part/details is stored in heap area , if the method declaration is static, the declaration part /details is stored in class area.

4)The stack area is used for execution purpose
When a method is called , the method enters the stack memory/area executes the statements defined in the method body , after finishing  of execution it exit from the stack area

JVM does all execution , Before it does execution it has to allocate memory

-------------------------------------------

# 1)Compile time polymorphism

------> compile time polymorphism is
achieved with the help of method Overloading
Compile time polymorphism is referred as
Early Binding or static binding

Method Binding is happening in the compile time
,hence we call method Overloading as early binding
or static binding

Once the binding is done by the complier it cannot be rebinded
,Hence it is known as static polymorphism

Method Overloading is an Example for compile time polymorphism

In method Overloading ----> Out of so many methods, which method
implementation/body should get executed is decided by the complier
during Compile time....
--------------------------------
# Run time Polymorphism

----->Run time Polymorphism is achieved with the help of
1)Is-A relationship(Inheritance)
2)Method Overriding
3)Upcasting

1)When we call a Overridden method on a superclass reference,
the method implementation which gets executed is
dependent on the subclass acting upon it
Ex  Animal a2 = new Cat();
a2.sound():  //Meoww Meoww

2)Out of so many overridden methods , which method implementation
should get executed is decided by JVM at Runtime
,Hence we call it as Runtime Polymorphism

3)Runtime polymorphism is also called as
late-Binding/dynamic-binding/ Dynamic method Dispatch
  
Note: If we call a Overridden method on a Superclass reference,
always the Overridden method (Subclass)implementation
only gets executed
Ex:  Animal a1 = new Dog(); //upcasting
a1.sound();  //Boww Boww
---------------------------
# Abstraction
   
“Hiding the internal implementation logic of an Object(or application)
and showing only object Functionalities is known as Abstraction”

The abstraction specifies that don't show internal
implementation-logic and show only object functionalities.

1)abstract is keyword which is used with class and method
2)A class which is not declared using abstract keyword is
called as concrete class
3)Concrete class can allow only concrete methods
4)A class which is declared using abstract keyword is called as
abstract class
5)abstract class will allow both abstract methods and concrete methods
6)Concrete class will not allow abstract methods
7)concrete methods will have both method declaration  and method
implementation/body
8)abstract method will have only declaration part
but "No method body/implementation"
9)all abstract methods should be declared using abstract keyword





## Contract of abstract
or(what should we do when a class extends abstract class)

1Rule) When a class inherits an abstract class ,we have to override all the abstract methods and give implementation/body

2Rule) When a class inherits an abstract class ,and we don't want to override the inherited abstract method ,then make the subclass as abstract class




---------------------
}
​
Important Note:
can a class inherit an abstract class?
----->Yes
Can we create Object of abstract class
-----> No ...We cannot create Object of abstract class

--->abstract method cannot be private(if it is not
accessible outside the class how can i override and
give implementation so it cannot be private)

4)abstract methods cannot be static(static methods cannot be inhereted)
5)abstract methods cannot be final(because final methods
cannot be overridden)
6)can abstract class have constructors?
------->yes      but it has to be invoked by the subclass
constructor either implicitly or explicitly using super();





--------------------------------
# Interface

1)interface is a java type definition which
has to be declared using " interface " keyword.
2)interface is a medium between two systems, where
one system is client/user another system is
Object with  services
3)syntax:
interface  InterfaceName{
//set if instruction
}
4)Interface can have variables ,Those variables are automatically
public static and final.
5)interface can achieve Is-A relationship with
class using implements keyword

6)Interface can allow only abstract methods, those methods
are automatically public and abstract.
7)when a class implements an interface, mandatorily we should
override the abstract methods

8)while overriding the method, access specifier should
be same or of higher visibility
ex: Public ----to public is Correct
public ------protected ,default ,private is Wrong

9)A class can  implement any number of interfaces
(multiple inheritance)

10)A class can extend 1 class and implement
any number of interfaces

11)Interfaces doesn't contain Constructors
12)we cannot create object of an interface
13) In interface we can write static concrete methods(main  method)
-------------------------------

Abstraction
1)"The process of hiding the internal  implementation
details(unnecessary details) and showing only the object
functionalities(necessary things/Behaviour)to the user with
the help of abstract class or interface is called as abstraction"

2)Abstraction can be achieved by the following rules below
1)abstract class/ interface
2)Is-A relationship(inheritance)
3)upcasting
4)method Overriding
------------------------------


Has-A Relationship
(An Object containing another Object)
1)Composition
Imagine there are two classes A and B ,
A class has-A  B class in such a way that
A cannot function if B is not functioning
It is called as  "Tight Coupling".
Ex: Mobile and Battery
Human and Heart
Human and Oxygen
Car and Tire
(Boys relationship with a girl---> if your not there I m not there)

2)Aggregation
A class has-A  B class in such a way that
A can function if B is not functioning,
It is called as "Loose Coupling".
Ex: Mobile and Sim card
Human and food
Human and mobile
(Girl relationship with boy, if not u someone else)
